This software is designed for automating cisco config on several ports (I used it for cisco switches)

When you have to check a port configuration, you just have to type in the appropriate command 
But when you have several ports on which you want to see config, often you have to enter them one by one and it
can be rapidly annoying

I created this program for a project on which I had to check several ports on cisco switches 

I hope this program will help you 

If you have any suggestions on remarks; please feel free to contact me
